## About Me ✌🏽

Welcome to my website! I'm Yash, a fourth-year **undergraduate student at** <a href="https://www.ucsd.edu/" target = "_blank">**UC San Diego**</a>. I will be graduating with a double major in **Data Science** and **Cognitive Science: Machine Learning** in March 2023.

I'm originally from San Ramon, CA (SF Bay Area 🌉). In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new restaurants, cooking, and following/playing sports (go Niners and Warriors)!

Feel free to contact me or connect on LinkedIn!
