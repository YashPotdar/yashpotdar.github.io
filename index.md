## About Me ✌🏽

Welcome to my website! I'm Yash, a Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently a **Software Engineer** at Rivian and am concurrently pursuing a Masters in **Computer Science with a Specialization in Interactive Intelligence** at <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/" target = "_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>.

Previously, I studied at <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/" target = "_blank">UC San Diego</a>, where I graduated with highest honors (summa cum laude) while pursuing a double major in **Data Science** and **Cognitive Science: Machine Learning**.

I'm originally from the SF Bay Area 🌉. I enjoy traveling, experiencing new cultures through food, and playing/following sports (go Niners and Warriors)!

One of my passions is teaching and mentorship. During my time at UCSD, I served as an Instructional Assistant for several undergraduate data science courses and led workshops for students interested in data science. Check out my [**workshops**](workshops)!

I'm a highly motivated individual interested in the fields of data science and AI, looking to make a positive impact by solving challenging problems. I'm always looking to learn something new and connect with others! Feel free to connect on LinkedIn!
